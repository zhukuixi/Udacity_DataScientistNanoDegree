## Project Motivation
For this project I am conducting exploratory data analysis using a [Seattle Airbnb open dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle) containing 3 datasets:  
 1. Listings, including full descriptions and average review score   
 2. Reviews, including unique id for each reviewer and detailed comments  
 3. Calendar, including listing id and the price and availability for that day 

Mainly, the goal is to have a better understanding these 3 questions:  

 - Q1. As a traveler, is choosing an Airbnb unit hosted by a superhost worth It?
 - Q2. As a investor, what are the key factors to consider for maximizing Airbnb unit performance? 
 - Q3. How has Airbnb developed in Seattle, and are there any observable trends or patterns?

I intend to follow the CRISP-DM process to systematically explore the data, gain valuable insights and effectively communicate my findings via a blog post on Medium to the board audience.

## File Descriptions
