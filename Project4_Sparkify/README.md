## Project Motivation

In this project, I leveraged my data science expertise to address the customer churn issue for Sparkify, a fictional music streaming service. With premium account revenue being a vital revenue stream for the company, our goal was to create a classifier that can detect potential churn customers. Additionally, we aimed to uncover actionable insights that could inform strategic business decisions, ultimately safeguarding millions in revenue for the company.

I intend to follow the CRISP-DM process to systematically explore the data, gain valuable insights and effectively communicate my findings via a blog post on Medium to the board audience.
